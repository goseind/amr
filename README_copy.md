# Ball ü•é Schubser ü§ñ

A robot ü§ñ that pushes a ball ü•é (into a goal ü•Ö).

## Startup Instructions

1. Run `docker-compose up`
2. Start Turtlebot and connect to via SSH `ssh ubuntu@192.168.31.4` with default password: `turtlebot`
3. Make sure the environment variables 

## Some ROS Commands

- ui: `rqt`
- list all packages: `rospack list-names`
- build packages inside `~/catkin_ws`: catkin_make
- start master: `roscore`

## Turtlebot üê¢ Configuration

```bash
export TURTLEBOT3_MODEL=burger
export ROS_MASTER_URI=192.168.168.5
roslaunch turtlebot3_bringup turtlebot3_core.launch # bring-up cmd without LIDAR sensor
```

Manual start for webcam:

```bash
ssh ubuntu@192.168.168.4
roslaunch
roslaunch usb_cam usb_cam-test.launch
roslaunch turtlebot3_bringup turtlebot3_core.launch # or turtlebot3_robot.launch
```

## (Local) Network Configuration

Turtlebot and PC have a static IP configured:

* Turtlebot IP: `192.168.31.4`
* Remote PC IP: `192.168.31.5` (master)

They are connected to the lab router with SSID: `ParadiseCity`.

Refer to [Network Manager YML](turtlebot/50-cloud-init.yaml).

## Detection Node

Download weights for yolov4 https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet/releases/download/darknet_yolo_v3_optimal/yolov4.weights
Move the weights into detect/yolo_node/weights.

Dependencies:

* tensorflow
* pandas
* opencv-python
* matplotlib

## Lessons Learned

* The default user `ubuntu` on the Turtlebot image does not have the proper `tty` permissions. The problem could be solved by adding `ubuntu` to `root` user group, by executing: `sudo usermod -aG root ubuntu`, as the normal group used for that called `dialout` was not set for `tty`.
* ROS machines must have a resolved DNS name as they communicate with each other, see: http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/NetworkSetup

## Raspi cam

```

sudo apt install libraspberrypi-dev libraspberrypi0 libpigpiod-if-dev ros-noetic-compressed-image-transport ros-noetic-camera-info-manager ros-noetic-diagnostic-updater

cd ~/catkin/src
git clone https://github.com/UbiquityRobotics/raspicam_node
catkin_make

roslaunch raspicam_node camerav2_1280x960.launch
```
